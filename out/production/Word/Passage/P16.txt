Currently, Sulandian television journalists are twice as likely as other workers to support the Blue Party, and Sulandian journalism students are significantly more likely to support the Blue Party than working television journalists are. Therefore, assuming that these students do not change their political affiliations as they get older, the disparity between the political affiliations of Sulandia’s television journalists and those of the rest of the working population will increase as current Sulandian journalism students enter the profession.

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?

A. Few of the television journalists currently working in Sulandia were trained in Sulandian journalism schools. 

B. Journalists in Sulandia whose political affiliations differ from those of the general population tend to allow their political views to affect the way they report news about politics. 

C. Most of the television journalists currently working in Sulandia who support the Blue Party also supported the Blue Party when they were students. 

D. Support for the Blue party is not significantly less common among those current Sulaidan journalism students who intend to become television journalists than it is among current Sulandian journalism students as a whole. 

E. Classes in Sulandian journalism schools are not taught mainly by working Sulandian journalists.
