One reason researchers have long believed that Mars never enjoyed an extensive period of warm and wet climate is that much of the surface not covered by wind -borne dust appear to be composed of unweathered material. If water flowed for an extended period, researchers reasoned, it should have altered and weathered the volcanic minerals, creating clays or other oxidized, hydrated phases (minerals that incorporate water molecules in their crystal structure) .

It turns out, though, that the scientists were not looking closely enough. New high-resolution mapping data and close-up surface studies have revealed clays and other hydrated minerals in many regions. The clay deposits are scattered all over, in ancient volcanic surfaces and heavily cratered highland regions, some of which have apparently been exposed by erosion only recently.

1.	According to the passage, scientists are able to discover weathered material on the Martian surface because they have benefited from which of the following? 

A. a new method to analyze volcanic craters created on the Martian surface.  B. an improved ability to detect hydrated materials on the Martian surface

C. a more sophisticated understanding of the effect of wind-borne dust on the Martian surface D. a decision to look for water primarily in heavily cratered highland regions. 

E. a better understanding of how erosion might affect clay deposits.

Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.

2.	It can be inferred from the passage that the author would agree with which of the following statements regarding the reasoning discussed in the highlighted sentence? 

A. It provides the basis for an explanation of why water on Mars has been difficult to find until recently.

B. It correctly identifies a consequence of water flowing on the Martian surface. 

C. It depends on a false assumption about how water and volcanic materials interact on Mars.
