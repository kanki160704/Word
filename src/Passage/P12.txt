A plant- based automobile fuel has just become available in Ternland. A car can be driven as far on a gallon of the new plant-based fuel as a car can be driven on a gallon of gasoline, but a gallon of the plant-based fuel both costs less and results in less pollution. Therefore, drivers in Ternland who switch to it will reduce the amount they spend on fuel in a year while causing less environmental damage.

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? 

A. There is no expense associated with operating an automobile that is higher when the automobile uses the plant-based fuel than when it uses gasoline. 

B. Automobiles that have been operated using the plant-based fuel can no longer be operated using regular gasoline. 

C. The environmental damage attributable to automobiles is due almost entirely to the production and combustion of fuel automobiles use. 

D. The advantages of the plant-based fuel over gasoline will not lead those who switch to the plant-based fuel to do more driving. 

E. Most drivers in Ternland will switch from gasoline to the plant-based fuel.
