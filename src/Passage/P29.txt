For years, the leading theory for what caused the Younger Dryas (a dramatic reversal, about 12,900 years ago, in a global warming trend) was a release of water from Glacial Lake Agassiz. The theory posited that this meltwater flooded into the North Atlantic, lowering the salinity and intensity of surface waters enough to prevent them from sinking. Ocean currents were changed in such a way that northward transport of heat in the ocean diminished, and the North Atlantic regions plunged back into near-glacial conditions. However, evidence has emerged that the Younger Dryas began long before freshwater flooded the North Atlantic. Additionally, the temperature changes induced by a shutdown in the North Atlantic heat conveyor system are too small to explain the Younger Dryas.

1.	The author of the passage implies which of the following about the release of water from glacial Lake Agassiz? 

A. The notion that the release occurred has been challenged by more recent findings.  B. The release probably occurred much earlier than scientists have generally assumed.

C. The release would not have been sufficient to cause any temperature change in the North Atlantic. 

D. The timing of the release is such that it probably did not trigger the onset of the Younger Dryas. E. The release was probably unrelated to the global warming trend that was taking place.

2.	The passage is primarily concerned with 

A. presenting evidence that undermines an explanation

B. explaining the nature of a climatological phenomenon

C. questioning the timing of a particular event 

D. discussing a new explanation for a phenomenon 

E. suggesting revisions to a popular theory
