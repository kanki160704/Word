Although some skeptics points to Arctic places such as the high latitudes of Greenland, where temperatures seem to have fallen, a recent scientific report concludes that in recent decades average temperatures have increased faster in the Arctic than elsewhere. Scientists have long suspected that several factors lead to greater temperature swings at Earths polar regions than elsewhere. First, most of the Arctic is covered in snow and ice, which are highly reflective; if snow and ice melt, the exposed soil, which absorbs heat, serves to accelerate warming. Second, the polar atmosphere is thin, so little energy is required to warm it. Third, less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics.

1. Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 

The passage mentions which of the following as factors that might lead to large temperature swings in Earths polar regions? 

A. the amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles  B. soil exposure due to melting snow 

C. the relatively thin atmosphere at the poles

2.	In pointing to the apparent temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland, the skeptics mentioned in the passage intend to raise as a question whether 

A. Greenland is less likely to experience extreme temperature changes than are other areas of the Arctic.

B. Those more localized temperature drops might indicate an important trend not captured by the upward trend of average Arctic temperatures. 

C. There might be a reversal of the temperature trend in the high latitudes of Greenland.

D. The factors that cause temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland are different from those that affect the rest of the Arctic. 

E. Greenland has more ice and snow on the ground than do other areas of the Arctic.
