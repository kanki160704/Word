An alarming number of Mediterranean monk seals, an endangered species, have recently died. Postmortem analysis showed the presence of an as yet unidentified virus, as well as evidence of a know bacterial toxin. Seawater samples from the area where the seals died did contain unusually high concentrations of the toxic bacterium. Therefore, although both viruses and bacterial toxins can kill seals, it is more likely that these deaths were the result of the bacterial toxin.

Which of the following, if true, provides additional evidence to support the conclusion?  A. Viruses are much more difficult to identify in postmortem analysis than bacteria are.

B. Mediterranean monk seals are the only species of seal in the area where the bacterium was found. 

C. The bacterium is almost always present in the water in at least small concentrations. D. Nearly all the recent deaths were among adult seals, but young seals are far more susceptible to viruses than are adult seals. 

E. Several years ago, a large number of monk seals died in the same area as a result of exposure to a different bacterial toxin.
